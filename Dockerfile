# ---- Build stage: compiles the Tailwind CSS build. The ~35-40MB Tailwind CLI binary and the
# build-only Python packages that fetch it never reach the runtime image below - see
# docs/adr/design-refresh-per-service-tailwind-build.md (organize-me). The compile step (below) is
# a separate RUN layer from `COPY app`, but Docker's cache invalidation still cascades correctly:
# any change under app/ invalidates `COPY app` and therefore forces the compile layer to rerun too,
# so cached CSS can never silently drift out of sync with the templates it was built from.
